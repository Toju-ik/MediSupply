# MediSupply Use Cases

## 1. Overview
MediSupply is a database-driven Django web application designed to streamline the purchase order process for healthcare institutions. The system enables hospital staff to create purchase orders for medical supplies, allows a purchasing manager to review and approve these orders, and permits suppliers to update order status (e.g., shipped, delivered). Additional administrative functions support user and system management. This document details all use cases that our project will implement.

## 2. Actors
- **Hospital Staff:**  
  Initiates new purchase orders and views their order history.
- **Purchasing Manager:**  
  Reviews purchase orders submitted by Hospital Staff, approves or rejects orders, and can request modifications.
- **Supplier:**  
  Views approved purchase orders and updates the order status (e.g., shipped or delivered).
- **Administrator:**  
  Manages system settings, user roles, and overall configuration (basic administration).
